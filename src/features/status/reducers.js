/**
 * Standard redux reducer used to control the state of Status component that is always located in footer.  Basically the idea is to update the user
 * as to
 * what's going on at all times, but especially when NOTHING is changing in the UI, some part of it is unusable because a tx is pending, or to
 * display that a tx is pending & confirmed.
 *
 * The message is the message that will be displayed to the users, obviously.
 * The txSubmitted state/property should be set to true every time a transaction is submitted to the blockchain so we can start a timer countdown.
 *
 * Unfortunately we need to call another reducer (or do we? -- haven't thought about it much) to set the status to the default in our actions.
 *
 * Some of these are imperceptibly fast, mostly the IPFS ones.  But users may find this interesting over time, focus on it, and frankly it could
 * keep people coming back.  Knowing what is going on is comforting, despite this needing extra code, especially in our actions, and when
 * dispatching actions just for changing this status.
 *
 * One alternative is to not dispatch any actions or update the status for any state change that doesn't change other state (or in other words
 * where the action.type is not called elsewhere).
 *
 * Finally, writing a separate function with a delay definable in the action creator is another option of handling this state change in a way that
 * actually displays something to the user long enough for them to see it.
